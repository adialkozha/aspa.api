## Project Description
During this semester, our team is going to implement a website that will serve online users with shopping.

We have chosen a medium-sized project that will perform the following functions:
```bash
- Add to basket
- Remove from basket
- Search from the catalog
- View recommended items
- Add to wishlist, also they can remove
- Purchase the selected items
- Admin can add, remove: products, users and shippers
```
We chose a web application for the theme of the project. For now we don't chose what kind of tools we will use for DB, Server and so on. Within the two day we will correct this uncertainty. 
```bash
- MSsql
```
