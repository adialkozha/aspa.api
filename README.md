## Project Description
During this semester, our team is going to implement website which will help users to book and see restaurants and cafes of all categories. Why do we need this website? 
Now in modern society it is fashionable to offer ideas that make life easier for people. This is what immediately comes to mind of any person before creating something. Our project will prevent such disadvantages in the service as queuing at restaurants (with no free tables), wasting time waiting / searching for restaurants by phone calls. With this site, users will be able to quickly and in one place solve the problem of finding the place they need for dinner, family gathering and other events.

We have chosen a medium-sized project that will perform the following functions:
*book restaurants and cafes
*search for a place at the user's request (by rate, thematic)
*write a feedback to these restaurants
*Find nearest restaurants
*will show is there open or closed
